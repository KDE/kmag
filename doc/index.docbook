<abstract>
<para>
&kmag; is a screen magnifier for the K Desktop Environment (KDE). It can be
used to magnify a portion of the screen for various purposes.
</para>

<!-- This is a set of Keywords for indexing by search engines.
Please at least include KDE, the KDE package it is in, the name
 of your application, and a few relevant keywords. -->

<!-- The contents of the documentation begin here.  Label
each chapter so with the id attribute. This is necessary for two reasons: it
allows you to easily reference the chapter from other chapters of your
document, and if there is no ID, the name of the generated HTML files will vary
from time to time making it hard to manage for maintainers and for the CVS
system. Any chapter labelled (OPTIONAL) may be left out at the author's
discretion. Other chapters should not be left out in order to maintain a
consistent documentation style across all KDE apps. -->

<chapter id="introduction">
<title>Introduction</title>

<!-- The introduction chapter contains a brief introduction for the
application that explains what it does and where to report
problems. Basically a long version of the abstract.  Don't include a
revision history. (see installation appendix comment) -->

<para>
KMag lets you magnify a portion of the screen. It consists of a zoom
view window where you can see the magnified image. The user can choose to
magnify either a selected portion of the screen, or magnify as the mouse is
moved around.
</para>

<title>Using K Magnifier</title>

<!-- This chapter should tell the user how to use your app. You should use as
many sections (Chapter, Sect1, Sect3, etc...) as is necessary to fully document
your application. -->

<para>

<!-- Note that all graphics should be in .png format. Use no gifs because of
patent issues. -->

</para>

<para>
After running kmag, you will see a window similar to the one show above. You
can either magnify a fixed portion of the screen, or you can magnify the
contents around the mouse cursor.
<para>
</para>
To magnify the contents around the mouse cursor, select "follow mouse". Now
as you move the mouse, you will see that the screen around the mouse cursor
is magnified and shown in the magnifier window.
</para>
<para>
If "follow mouse" is not selected, then a fixed part of the screen is magnified.
You can see which part of the screen is being magnified by clicking on
"show selection". To move this selector, hold the left mouse key down while the
cursor is inside the zoom view window and then drag the mouse around. This way you
can move the contents of the zoom view window and the selection area will move
accordingly. By using the middle mouse button, its possible to move the entire
selection area around. By using the Control key and the left mouse button, its
possible to resize this area.
</para>

<sect1 id="kmag-features">
<title>More Kapp features</title>

<para>KMag comes with lots of features. Its possible to "print" the zoomed
image directly to a printer, "save" the image to a file, "copy" the zoomed
image to the clipboard (which can be later used to paste in other applications),
show different mouse cursors etc.

<!--
List any special requirements for your application here. This should include:
.Libraries or other software that is not included in kdesupport,
kdelibs, or kdebase.
.Hardware requirements like amount of RAM, disk space, graphics card
capabilities, screen resolution, special expansion cards, etc.
.Operating systems the app will run on. If your app is designed only for a
specific OS, (you wrote a graphical LILO configurator for example) put this
information here.
-->

<para>
KMag is being developed on KDE ver 2.2.2, but it should compile on any KDE with
version 2.x. A KDE3 version of KMag will be released soon. Other than KDE, there
is no requirement for KMag.

<sect1 id="compilation">
<title>Compilation and Installation</title>

<para>
In order to compile and install KMag on your system, download the source package,
uncompress it and then run the following after going into the directory:

<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>./configure</userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>make</userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>make install</userinput>

<para>Since KMag uses autoconf and automake you should have not trouble
compiling it. Should you run into problems please report them to the
kmag-devel mailing list (kmag-devel@lists.sf.net).</para>
